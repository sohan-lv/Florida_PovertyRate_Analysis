# Florida Poverty Rate Analysis (2012–2023)

# Overview
This project pulls poverty rate data for selected major Florida counties and cities from the U.S. Census Bureau API (ACS data) between 2012 and 2023. 

Note: I chose the ACS 5-Year estimates over the 1-Year estimates for their broader geographic coverage, higher statistical reliability, and smoother year-over-year comparability. While the data uses overlapping 5-year samples, each year’s release reflects updated weights and is suitable for stable trend tracking, especially in counties and cities with smaller populations.

### The API key is hardcoded for demonstration purposes.

This data is collected using Python and saved into an Excel file for further analysis and visualization.
